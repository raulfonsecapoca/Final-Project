**What exactly are your trying to do? Please describe.**
Sometimes, it's just a matter of documentation where the right method already exists. Don't hesitate to describe your goal with high level details so that we can better discuss and imagine a generalized solution.

Example
> I want to be able to resize my images and their bounding box annotations accordingly

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.

- Especially, if you can, explain how you would like the code interface to be with an example.
- If you already have an idea of how to implement the solution, don't hesitate to share pointers here

Example
> The ideal solution would look like this
>
> ```python
> my_dataset = my_dataset.resize(size=(220,220))
> my_dataset.to_caipy(output_folder)
> ```
